# hello-world
This is where I can store ideas, resources or share and discuss things with others:

Introduction:
I am new to learning web development.  I am learning html and css and plan on learning JavaScript.  My goal is to be able to develop websites from the ground up.  Ultimatley I would like to be fluent in both front-end and back-end development.  My background is that of a solar installer and electrician.  Although I spent most of my time installing electrical and solar systems, my schooling and expirience gave me the abilities to read schematics and understand design methods that allowed me to design and install a expansion of a solar array on my fathers house.  Currently I am a union electrician but I hope to be able to transition to a career in web development within a year.  I        
am very passionate about the skill of wed development and I am excited to embark on a path of continuous learning.
